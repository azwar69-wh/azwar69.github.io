set source character i select **AUTO-SELECT.**

#### I was first given a browser tor link to find out the malicious information
LINK ```http://torpastezr7464pevuvdjisbvaf4yqi4n7sgz7lkwgqwxznwy5duj4ad.onion/aRr1wftJbeX7cMjQ```

after that I paste the link in the browser tor then I get it. ```WHC{D4RK_W3B_B3NG1NN3R}```
![This is an image](/e96be350-4165-427c-9bda-003a66366a77.jpg)
then I think this is not the flag because just paste the link and get the flag.but I tried it for once only and the flag was correct
#### FLAG ```WHC{D4RK_W3B_B3NG1NN3R}```
